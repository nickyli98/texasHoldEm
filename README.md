This project was inspired by this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44&t=1s

I've always had a slight interest in Machine Learning, as I thought the possibilites of it was endless. This video tied my interest in AI, as well as computer games together.

I was inclined to do something like that, and at the time I was fairly into texas poker, so I decided to write a command line based texas hold'em and train an AI on it.

However, when 90% completed with the command line game, I realized that just by training it against itself, it will never learn the human factor of the game, bluffing etc. 

Therefore I decided to stop the project, and continue the project once again when I figure out how to train it against real humans.
